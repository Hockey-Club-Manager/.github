## Idea
We are creating a hockey managers simulator with a large number of actions. All the objects will be presented as NFT, and we going to integrate crypto-processes as game mechanics. At the same time, we will do PvP and PvE matches with a large number of game actions.

The idea came up in December 2021, while preparing for a hackathon from Near. At this hackathon, we received a prize and decided to move on. There were three of us, since that time our team has grown more than 4 times.

## Gameplay
Game objects:
* Player cards
* Personnel cards
* Tactic cards
* Hockey equipment 

Game actions:
* Team management
* Cards trading
* PvP and PvE matches

Working through the game mechanics, we largely focused on card tactical and strategic games. Users will have the opportunity to manage game in all aspects, improve their players and team in different ways, like stacking player NFTs, merging player and equipment NFTs, lending or borrowing NFTs, and so on. 

Cards trading also will be gamified with auctions, drafts, rent, and exchange. 

Matches could be PvP or PvE, leagues and tournaments will be provided. In-match actions will be generated depending on previous actions of partners/opponents, area of action, and even the character of the player. 

## How to earn
There are two ways of earning money in our game. By winning games or by trading players. You can collect the roaster of your dream, practice hard, think strategically, and win against opponents. Or you can buy players, improve them and sell for a higher price. And of course, you can do both.
